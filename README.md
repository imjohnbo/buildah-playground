# Buildah Playground

This example project shows how [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah), [Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive), and [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) can be used with GitHub Actions, GitHub Container Registry, and Azure Container Registry. ðŸš€

[`site`](site) is built, pushed to a "dev" registry, tested for optimization, then pushed to a "prod" registry.

## Setup

* Create an Azure Container Registry ([CLI docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/acr?view=azure-cli-latest#az-acr-create))
* Create a service principal that has push access to the registry ([docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal#create-a-service-principal))
* Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with [scopes necessary](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images#authenticating-with-the-container-registry) to push an image to [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry)

### Secrets

Required secrets:
* `CR_PAT` - PAT w/ proper scopes for GHCR
* `AZ_LOGIN` - Azure Service Principal ID
* `AZ_PASSWORD` - Azure Service Principal Password
* `AZ_REGISTRY` - Azure Container Registry name

## Usage

Upon `push` to [`site`](site) or manual trigger, [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) kicks off, building a container image out of [`site`](site) using Buildah, tagging it with the Git `sha` and pushing to GitHub Container Registry, pulling it down again to run optimization tests, then pushed to Azure Container Registry.
